The wire must not carry the delimiter, because nothing constrains artists.artist_name from containing "|" or " | " — a joined string would silently split into phantom aliases on the consumer side (library-metadata-lookup splits this field on the pipe) with no escaping rule to recover from, and the legacy MySQL source has the same latent bug plus GROUP_CONCAT\'s silent group_concat_max_len truncation. Array-on-the-wire retires both.\nDerivation (pinned, because the legacy query it replaces is load-bearing for the producer — LIBRARY_CODE_CROSS_REFERENCE in discogs-etl/scripts/sync-library.sh):\n  * BOTH FK directions — an artist_crossreference row matching on\n    either source_artist_id or target_artist_id contributes its\n    OTHER side.\n  * EXCLUDES the row\'s own artist (the legacy query\'s\n    `AND xlc.ID != lc.ID`).

The legacy GROUP_CONCAT has no ORDER BY\n    at all, so there is no legacy order to match — pick the\n    deterministic one.\n\nFRESHNESS: this endpoint\'s conditional GET rides library_watermark. Migration 0105 fanned the watermark trigger out to library, artists, genres, format, genre_artist_crossreference, and rotation; artist_crossreference was left uncovered until migration 0138 added touch_library_watermark_from_artist_crossreference (AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE OR TRUNCATE ... FOR EACH STATEMENT). A cross-reference write now advances the watermark, the per-watermark gzip cache rebuilds, and the producer\'s next fetch carries the new alias.

Duplicate positions receive the shared verdict, but a qualified name is its own work unit — a Discogs-style disambiguator denotes a different artist than the bare name, so it never inherits (or supplies) the bare form\'s verdict, and it resolves only when the API candidate\'s own title carries the same qualifier. A name whose only content IS a bracketed group ("(Smog)") is a bare name, not a qualifier — the normalizer makes the same refusal. A verified mint is keyed on the group\'s lexicographically-least sanitized spelling (deterministic in batch content — the same representative the API probe uses; the store\'s read legs are case-insensitive, so any spelling stays findable), EXCEPT when the identity read found an existing row for the name that lacks `discogs_artist_id` — the mint then fills that row\'s stored key in place rather than inserting a near-duplicate key (deterministically, the lexicographically-least stored key when several id-less rows match); qualified names never mint. Names that are blank, contain U+0000 or unencodable code points, normalize to an empty identity-match form, or whose entire identity content is a bare parenthesized ASCII number ("(2)", "[2]", "(2)(3)" — a Discogs disambiguator whose artist name was lost upstream; a fully-bracketed NON-numeric name like "(Smog)" stays resolvable) are rejected with 422 — never given an in-band verdict (`not_found` means the API tier ran and measured zero).\n',

When `false` or omitted — the default, and what an un-upgraded caller sends — `BulkResolveResult.tracks` is absent from every result, so an album-identity drain pays nothing for track composition it would discard. When `true`, LML composes per-track identity for both `kind: single_artist` and `kind: compilation` results and sets `tracks_attempted` on each of them; `kind: unresolved` never carries either field. See `BulkResolveResult.tracks_attempted` for the four states the pair distinguishes, and why the array's length is not one of them.\n\nThe flag is batch-level by design, and the payload it admits is not bounded by the schema — `inputs` still caps at 1,000 either way. A caller that can classify its own rows should partition its drains rather than send a mixed page: Backend holds both signals LML auto-detects on (`library.code_volume_letters LIKE 'Z%'`, `EXISTS compilation_track_artist`), so WXYC/Backend-Service#1991 runs a small-paged V/A drain separately from a full-width non-V/A one.
