"""Unit tests for the authenticated download path of ``scripts/generate_api_models.sh`` (#268).

The Codegen Freshness CI job fetches ``api.yaml`` from raw.githubusercontent.com,
which rate-limits anonymous requests per source IP -- and Actions runners share
IP pools, so the job is exposed to intermittent 429s. WXYC/library-metadata-lookup#1205
documented three such failures in a single day on the job this one mirrors, each
needing a manual ``gh run rerun --failed``; whether a given run passes is IP-pool
luck. This repo's copy of the script had the same anonymous shape, so the fix was
ported before the shared pool has a bad day here too.

Three safety properties are pinned:

- the token travels on curl's **stdin** (``-H @-``), never argv (visible in
  ``ps``) and never stdout/stderr;
- a failed authenticated attempt retries once anonymously -- GitHub 404s (not
  401s) raw requests carrying a stale token, so without the fallback an expired
  ambient token would turn previously-working local runs into hard 404s;
- the token is dropped from the environment at the top of the script, before
  the source-resolution branch, so no child process inherits it on EITHER arm
  -- the sibling-checkout arm never downloads, so a scrub placed inside the
  download branch misses the default local invocation entirely.

See the script's header comment for the canonical rationale; this module pins
the properties, it does not restate the reasoning.

Each test runs the real script via subprocess, hermetically: a stub ``curl``
first on ``PATH`` records each invocation's argv, stdin, and token-bearing
environment (so no network), and the script is copied into a throwaway repo
under ``tmp_path`` with no sibling ``wxyc-shared`` beside it, which is what
forces the download branch. Stub ``datamodel-codegen`` and ``ruff`` stand in for
the codegen stages that follow, which are out of scope here.
